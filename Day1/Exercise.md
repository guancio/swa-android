# Day 1 / Exercise

## Excercise 1
Implement a converter from meter to feet.
The user should input a number (in a EditText) representing
a distance in meter, press a button, and get the
conversion in yard (e.g. using a toast or writing the conversion
in a second EditText).

One meter is equivalent to 3.28084 foots.

## Excercise 2
Extend your application to converter from meter to feet,
inches and yards.
The user inputs the distance in meter and use a different button
for each  target unit measure
(foots, inches and yards).

One meter is equivalent to 3.28084 foots.
A foot comprises 12 inches and three feet compose a yard.
